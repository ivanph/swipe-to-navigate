# Swipe To Navigate VSCode Extension

## Feature

### Adding support for navigating: 
- Currently opened tabs.
- Currently opened tabs within a group.
- Recently focused code and opened files.
- Recently opened files.


## Supported Platforms:

### `macOS`

Navigate using three finger swipes on the touchpad in a similar fashion to Xcode.

### `Windows` & `Linux`
Navigate using keyboard media keys or browser commands, as well as the "Back" button built into some mice on Windows.
    
## Supported configuration options

### `swipeToNavigate.action: "disabled" |Â "tabs" |  "grouped-tabs" | "recent-code" | "recent-files"`

#### Examples 

##### Currently opened tabs (default).
```jsonc
    "swipeToNavigate.action": "tabs"
```

##### Currently opened tabs in a single group.
```jsonc
    "swipeToNavigate.action": "grouped-tabs"
```

##### Recently focused code and files (like Xcode).
```jsonc
    "swipeToNavigate.action": "recent-code"
```

##### Recently opened files.
```jsonc
    "swipeToNavigate.action": "recent-files"
```


## How does it work?

Swipe To Navigate  relies on the [Monkey Patch Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iocave.monkey-patch) to inject custom javascript in VSCode. After installation you should
be prompted to enable Monkey Patch. You can always trigger this manually by invoking the "Enable Monkey Patch" command.

## Why Monkey Patch? 
Was initially posted as a [PR](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82588) to `VSCode` but [this](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82588) discussion indicated that they're trying to limit further code that depends on `Electron` APIs
